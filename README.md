# LM4J

Simplifying natural language handling in Java. These classes make it easy to read lang-like (plain text) files and return results safely.

## Table of Contents

- **Lang**: Interface that represents any language class.
- **DefaultLang**: Concrete language manager that takes a file path and searches for it inside resources.

## Features

- Modular components, reusable across many projects
- Lightweight and extensible design philosophy

## Usage

Precompiled versions of the library can be found under the `releases/` directory. This is done to allow ease of download without requiring GitHub's GUI.

## Build It Yourself

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile with Maven (`mvn compile package`).
